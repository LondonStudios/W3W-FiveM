# London Studios - Update
Since forming London Studios in April 2020 we've created a number of **high quality** and **premium** resources for the FiveM project, focusing on the emergency services and aiming to bring your server to the next level.

Although we made a number of free resources such as this one in the first year, we've now switched to creating paid content, keeping them constantly updated and working along with providing the best possible support to our customers.

Our **most popular** resources now include *Smart Fires, Police Grappler* and *Smart Hose*.

With **thousands** of **happy customers** we are confident you'll love our resources and our active support team are on hand to help if you have any questions!

# Our store: https://store.londonstudios.net/github
# Our discord: https://discord.gg/nC2krpN

Therefore, this resource is now likely *out of date* and is *no longer supported by us*. The full source code is available should you wish to make any changes. All of our paid resources however are constantly updated and we invite you to take a look!

# W3W - London Studios - (Free)
This free resource is a great addition to any roleplay server, allowing the use of What3Words inside FiveM. Instead of coordinates, players are now able to get their location using three words, which can be shared with other players quickly and a waypoint can be set to them using a simple command.

The map is essentially broken up into squares and each position has a unique what3words location, we've included a list of English words found online, you are able to change these - even to another language.

This plugin is made by **LondonStudios**, we have created a variety of releases including TaserFramework, SearchHandler, ActivateAlarm, SmartTester, SmartSounds, CustodyAlarm, SmartObservations and more!

## Free Resource
This is where we'd usually direct you to our Tebex store, but instead this time you download this from GitHub as we've released it for free here.

## Usage

**/w3w** - This will get your current location in chat as three words.
**/w3w word1.word2.word3** - The words must be formatted with a dot between each and if found, a waypoint will be set to the target location, allowing backup to easily be called on scene.

## Framework Integration - vRP / ESX / Others
-   **Permission checks**  - You can easily edit the cl_w3w.lua file to add permissions.
- 
## Installation
 1.  Download the resource from GitHub here.
 2. Create a new resource folder in your server directory.
 4. Place the contents of the downloaded .zip inside the resource folder.
## Feedback
We appreciate feedback, bugs and suggestions related to W3W and future plugins. We hope you enjoy using the resource and look forward to hearing from people and seeing videos/screenshots of the plugin in action!
